This is a snake game written in python using the pygame module. I have written the code for the basic snake game by following a youtube tutorial and added several additional features likes-
i)crossing the boundary
ii)buttons that change color when the cursor hovers over them
iii)saving the highscore
iv)level system with obstacles
Each time you reach the maximum score for a certain level, you progress to the next level with a new level design until you finish the game.
