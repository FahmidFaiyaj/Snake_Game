I have written the code for the base snake game by following a youtube tutorial and added several features like -
i)boundary crossing
ii)buttons that change color when the cursor hovers over them
iii)saving highscore
iv)level system with obstacles

Base Snake game with boundary crossing added - Snake_V2
Final Snake game with level system - Snake_V3
