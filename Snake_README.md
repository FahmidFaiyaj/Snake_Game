I have written the code for the base snake game by following a youtube tutorial and added several features like -
i)boundary crossing
ii)saving highscore
iii)level system with obstacles

Snake.py - Base Snake game (217 lines)
Snake_V2 - Snake game with boundary crossing, saving highscore (252 lines)
Snake_V3 - Snake game with boundary crossing, saving highscore, level system with obstacles (354 lines)
Snake_V3_files - To be placed in the same directory as Snake_V3. Mandatory for running Snake_V3.py/Snake_V3.py
